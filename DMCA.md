# DMCA Policy & Takedown Requests

## About Koware

Koware is an **open-source software tool** that functions as a search aggregator and media player launcher. It is designed to be a general-purpose utility that:

- Does **not** host, store, or distribute any media content
- Does **not** include any pre-configured sources or links to streaming services
- Requires users to manually configure their own source definitions
- Acts purely as a client-side search interface

## No Bundled Sources

**Koware ships with zero pre-configured sources.** All source configurations must be provided by the user. The software itself contains no URLs, API endpoints, or references to any third-party streaming services.

This is similar to how a web browser does not include bookmarks to specific websites—users must add their own.

## User Responsibility

Users of Koware are solely responsible for:

1. Ensuring they have the legal right to access any sources they configure
2. Complying with applicable laws in their jurisdiction
3. Respecting the terms of service of any services they access
4. Obtaining proper licenses for any content they access
