# Usage Notice

Koware is a tool that automates fetching information and streams that are already publicly available on the internet. It does not host or distribute content; it only helps you discover and play what’s already accessible.

- Koware does NOT include or support bypassing paywalls or DRM.
- Do not use Koware to circumvent technical protection measures (e.g., DRM, encryption, access controls) or paywalls. Such circumvention may be unlawful under anti-circumvention laws (for example, US DMCA 17 U.S.C. §1201) and similar laws in your jurisdiction.
 
Using Koware itself as a local link/stream aggregation tool is not, by itself, intended to be an infringing or illegal activity. However, whether your actual usage is lawful depends entirely on what you access and how you access it, as well as on the laws and website terms that apply to you. Koware does not turn unauthorized or infringing content into authorized content.

- All usage is at your own risk and responsibility.
- Ensure you comply with your local laws, site terms of service, and any third-party rights (for example, rights held by copyright owners and streaming platforms) when using Koware.

By using Koware, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for how you access and use publicly available resources. Nothing in this document, the README, or the source code constitutes legal advice.
