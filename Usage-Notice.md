# Usage Notice

## What Koware Is

Koware is an **open-source search aggregator and media player launcher**. It is a general-purpose utility that:

- **Does NOT host, store, or distribute any media content**
- **Does NOT include any pre-configured sources or streaming links**
- Requires users to manually configure their own source definitions
- Acts purely as a client-side search interface for user-configured sources

## No Bundled Sources

**Koware ships with zero pre-configured sources.** The software is a framework that users must configure themselves. This is similar to how a web browser does not include bookmarks—users add their own.

## Legal Compliance

- Koware does NOT include or support bypassing paywalls or DRM.
- Do not use Koware to circumvent technical protection measures (e.g., DRM, encryption, access controls) or paywalls. Such circumvention may be unlawful under anti-circumvention laws (for example, US DMCA 17 U.S.C. §1201) and similar laws in your jurisdiction.

Using Koware itself as a local search aggregation tool is not, by itself, intended to be an infringing or illegal activity. However, whether your actual usage is lawful depends entirely on:

1. What sources you configure
2. What content you access
3. The laws in your jurisdiction
4. The terms of service of any services you access

**Koware does not turn unauthorized or infringing content into authorized content.**

## User Responsibility

- **All usage is at your own risk and responsibility.**
- You are solely responsible for the sources you configure and the content you access.
- Ensure you comply with your local laws, site terms of service, and any third-party rights (including rights held by copyright owners and streaming platforms).
- You must have the legal right to access any sources you configure.

## Disclaimer

By using Koware, you acknowledge that:

1. You are solely responsible for how you configure and use this software
2. The developers of Koware have no control over what sources users configure
3. Nothing in this document, the README, DMCA policy, or the source code constitutes legal advice

**If you do not agree with these terms, do not use this software.**
